# Introduction

Froyo is an extremely lightweight and capable framework for building user interfaces with plain-old vanilla JavaScript.

## Features

-   📖 Easy to learn
-   🐭 Extremely small (<2k gzipped)
-   ❤ For vanilla JavaScript lovers
-   🏋 Robust and scalable
-   🚀 Browser-ready (no tech stack required)
-   🐇 Great for rapid prototyping

## Who is Froyo for?

Froyo was created for teams and environments where a modern technical stack is either undesired, difficult, or impossible. Built exclusively with vanilla JavaScript, Froyo requires zero setup and is compatible with any browser out-of-the-box. Therefore, it is ideal for folks with those constraints.

## What Froyo is not

Froyo is not a replacement for popular UI frameworks like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), and [Angular](https://angularjs.org/). All of which are more sophisticated, have larger communities, and better support. If a particular team or environment can support those frameworks, they are better long-term solutions than Froyo.

## Feedback

All feedback is welcome. Are there things you like, things you don't? Are there ways to improve the documentation? Have you discovered a bug? Please reach out with any thoughts by [opening an issue](https://github.com/marksmccann/froyo/issues/new) on the project.
