## Who is Froyo for?

Froyo was created for teams and environments that are unable to support a traditional [single page app](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA) setup. Popular SPA frameworks like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), and [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) require a lot of setup and are difficult to integrate into existing systems, like a content management system (CMS). By contrast, Froyo is built exclusively with vanilla JavaScript and requires zero setup; it is compatible with practically any system. It is ideal for creating libraries of independent and encapsulated UI components that will run in any browser out-of-the-box.
